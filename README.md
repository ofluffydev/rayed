## Compiling

Because I'm stupid, you need to install raylib as a system package, which
is very easy on linux -- just use your package manager, and search for
`raylib-dev` or `raylib-devel`. 

I don't know how to do that on Windows. On macOS, brew might work.

After installing raylib, just run `build.sh`.
